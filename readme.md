# tpms_silencer
Open hardware that supports ASK/FSK transmit on 315/433MHz ISM bands. General point is to spoof TPMS sensors but
it could be used for anything.

Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433">rtl_433</a> project, wouldn't exist without their hard work for
decoding the TPMS in the first place.

# Todo
[ ] Verify 8MHz internal oscillator operation is good enough
[ ] Change programming header
[ ] Update schematic with new values
